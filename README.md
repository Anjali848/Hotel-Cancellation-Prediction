# Hotel-Cancellation-Prediction
The overall goal of the case is to provide actionable insight, based on the data available. The dataset contains real-life hotel stay data, with each row representing a hotel booking. Your teamâ€™s goal is to understand some key drivers for why people cancel hotel reservations and/or better predict who will cancel. To do this, you will use all of the skills you have developed in the labs/homework to make sense of a novel dataset, to perform some essential analyses on the dataset, and to explain/document what you have done, and your insights generated.
